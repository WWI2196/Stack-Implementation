# Stack Implementation using Linked List
This project implements the class `Stack` using a linked list. The stack supports various operations such as pushing, popping, printing, reversing, counting, and deleting elements.

## Overview
The `Stack` class is implemented using a linked list. This implementation includes the following operations:

1. **Push**: Insert an element into the stack.
2. **Pop**: Delete and return the top element from the stack.
3. **Print**: Print the value of all elements in the stack from top to bottom.
4. **Reverse**: Reverse all the values in the stack.
5. **Count**: Return the number of elements in the current stack.
6. **Delete**: Destroy the entire stack.
